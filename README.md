# GenAI Workshop Setup Guide
Welcome to this GenAI Workshop! To get you up and running smoothly, we've prepared a step-by-step guide on how to set up your programming environment. If you're new to programming or the tools we'll be using, don't worry! Just follow the instructions below, and you'll be set up in no time.

## 1. Cloning the Workshop Repository

First, we need to get the workshop materials onto your computer by cloning our code repository.

### Steps:

1. **Open Your Terminal:**
   - **Windows**: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" and open it.
   - **Mac**: Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd + Space) and open it.
   - **Linux**: Search for "Terminal" or press "Ctrl + Alt + T" to open it.
2. **Create a New Folder and Navigate There:**
   - Decide on a location where you want to store your workshop materials. For example, you can create a new folder in your "Documents" directory.
   - Type `cd` followed by the path to your chosen location, then press Enter.
     - Example: `cd /Users/yourusername/Documents/codepub`
3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In your terminal, paste the following command: 
     - `git clone https://github.com/alexandraant161803/genai-workshop.git`
   - After the cloning is complete, you will find a new folder called "genai-workshop" with all the code inside.

## 2. Installing Node.js

### Steps:

1. **Install Node.js:**
   - Go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the installer for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Node.js on your computer.

## 3. Installing Docker
Docker is a tool that allows you to run applications in a lightly isolated environment called a container.

### Steps:

1. **Download and Install Docker:**
   - [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your operating system and install it on your computer.
   - Open the Docker Desktop application to make sure it's running in the background.

## 4. Running the Workshop Code with Docker üê≥

We'll use Docker to automatically set up and connect the front-end and back-end parts of our workshop project.

### Steps:

1. **Return to Your Terminal:**
   - It should still be open from the previous steps.
2. **Navigate to the Workshop Folder:**
   - Type `cd path-to-genai-workshop-folder` into your terminal, replacing "path-to-genai-workshop-folder" with the actual path where your workshop folder is located (e.g., `cd /Users/yourusername/Documents/codepub/genai-workshop`), and press Enter.
3. **Start the Project with Docker:**
   - Copy and paste `docker-compose up --build` into your terminal and press Enter.
   - Wait for the process to complete. This may take a few minutes.
4. **Access the Frontend:**
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:4137` to view the workshop's front-end interface.
   - Optionally, you can also check the back-end documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**Congratulations!** You've successfully set up your environment for the GenAI Workshop. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help.

### Ready to Start Coding!

Explore the backend code by examining the file located at `backend/gen_ai_workshop_ai/prompts.py`. When you make changes and save the file, you should see the updates reflected on the front-end interface when you click "Get recipe".

### Recipe URLs for Testing:
