# GenAI Workshop
Welcome! Here are some instructions of how to get started!
First step is to get the backend and frontend running. 
You can do this using docker (recommended) or you can run each part natively on your system.

## Run backend and frontend with Docker 🐳 (Recommended)
When using docker, the frontend and backend will be started and connected automagically🪄
The backend is where you will be doing changes, and it supports hot reloading everytime you save.
Follow these steps: 
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root of this repository
2. Run 
    ```
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
3. You should now be able to access the frontend at `http://localhost:4137` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000/docs`. 
Ensure the frontend can reach the backend, it should let you know 😉
